This is the backend of my 1st semester project for the web development class. A pretty simple server system which handles data in the `ToDo` database. 
It handles GET, POST, DELETE and PATCH http requests and it has straight forward url routes.

Server is running on port 8000 locally. https://localhost:8000/ or https://*your ip address here*:8000/
